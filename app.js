//Challenge Questions
//1) Filter all presidents, leaving only the Democratic ones

const democrats = presidents.filter((presidents) => presidents.party === "D");
console.table(democrats);

//2)Filter all presidents to leave only one term Republican presidents HINT use If statement

const oneTermRepublicans = presidents.filter(
  (presidents) => presidents.party === "R" && presidents.terms === 1
);
console.table(oneTermRepublicans);

//3) return only the last three presidents

const lastThreePresidents = presidents.slice(0, 3);
console.table(lastThreePresidents);

//4) log all dems who served 2 terms. HINT use chain filter, filter and slice

const twoTermDemocrats = presidents.filter(
  (presidents) => presidents.party === "D" && presidents.terms === 2
);
console.table(twoTermDemocrats);

//BONUS write a script to check if LBJ was a 2 term president. IF he was then alert("LBJ served two terms") else alert "LBJ was one and done"

const LBJIndex = presidents.findIndex(
  (presidents) => presidents.name === "Lyndon Johnson"
);
if (presidents[LBJIndex].terms === 2) {
  alert("LBJ served two terms!");
} else {
  alert("LBJ was one and done!");
}
